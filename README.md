##About the game:

- Beneath Her Song is a text based cosmic horror game set in a small fishing village where you play as a lighthouse keeper who just moved into the town looking for work. You can explore, talk to locals, and discover the dark secrets that the ancient place has to offer. This game was created for the Themed Horror Game Jam #21 on itch.io. It has a focus on interactive storytelling in a retro text-based style, immersive atmosphere in a coatal folkloric setting, and simple exploration through text commands.

##How to play:

- Either download the files on github and run main.py, or just go to the itch.io link at https://casualgamedev.itch.io/beneath-her-song. The game is focused on player driven exploration, so I won't spoil much here, but the intro scene does tell you all the basic commands, and if you need to access them again you can just type 'help' in game.
